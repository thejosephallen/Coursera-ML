### Coursera-ML
This repository cointains Matlab programming exercises I did for an online [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) offered by Coursera. See below for a brief description of each exercise.

+ __ex1__ - In this exercise, I implemented linear regression on a dataset.
+ __ex2__ - In this exercise, I implemented logistic regression and applied it to two
different datasets.
+ __ex3__ - In this exercise, I implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
+ __ex4__ - In this exercise, I implemented the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
+ __ex5__ - In this exercise, I implemented regularized linear regression and used it to study models with different bias-variance properties.
+ __ex6__ - In this exercise, I used support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier. 
+ __ex7__ - In the first part of this exercise, I implemented a K-means clustering algorithm and applied it to compress an image. In the second part, I used principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
+ __ex8__ - In the first part of this exercise, I implemented an anomaly detection algorithm and applied it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, I used collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
